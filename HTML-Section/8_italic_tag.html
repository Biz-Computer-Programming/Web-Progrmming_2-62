    <h1>Emphasis and strong emphasis</h1>
    <p>HTML is the building blocks of web pages
    It specifies the structure of documents.</p> 
<hr />
<p>HTML plays an important part in web documents along with Cascading Style Sheets.</p>

<h2>The Bold Tag</h2>

<p>The bold tag (⟨b⟩) <b>represents</b> a span of text that you wish to highlight from the rest of the text without inferring any type of special relevance or meaning. As you would expect, browsers typically bold this text.</p>

<h2>The Strong Tag</h2>

<p>By using the strong tag (⟨strong⟩) <b>represents</b> a string of text as having strong importance. The text should be considered to be more important than the text surrounding it. This is displayed as bold, just like the using the bold tag.</p>

<h2><i>The Italic Tag</i></h2>

<p>Like the bold tag, the italic tag (⟨i⟩) <b>represents</b> a string of text that is highlighted from the text around it. No particular meaning is attached to the text when you use the (⟨i⟩) tag, it is just rendered in italics. Helpful for phrases, terms, or any text that is normally displayed in italics.</p>

<h2><em>The Emphasis Tag</em></h2>

<p>The <b>emphasis</b> tag (⟨em⟩), or "em" tag, denotes text that is emphasized more than the text around it. Although this tag is usually rendered in italics, it shouldn't be used in place of the italics tag, rather it should be used for text that needs to be emphasized for some reason.</p>
